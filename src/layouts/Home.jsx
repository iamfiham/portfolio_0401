                I’m Dale, a UK based product designer with over ten years of experience. I specialise in interface design for
                mobile and web-based applications with a focus on simplicity & usability. <br /> <br /> I’m currently working at
                WP Engine where I design some of the best products for WordPress including Advanced Custom Fields, WP Migrate and
                WP Offload Media. <br /> <br /> Before WP Engine, I worked at BaseKit where I helped shape the future of website
                builders and tools to help small businesses thrive online. In my spare time I also work on projects like Design
                Vault and Good Aesthetic Club.
